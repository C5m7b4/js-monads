Im choosing javascript playground for this repo. then just answer the questions for if you want as git repo and if you want to install the dependencies. I would suggest at least for installing the dependencies as you are going to have to do that at some point.

now you can open that project in vscode.

now lets bring up the terminal and type 

```js
npm start
```

you should be presented with this in the console after webpack starts up
